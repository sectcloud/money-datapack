## Using

### 💸 Sending Money

To send money, just type:

```mcfunction
/trigger ec.pay
```

and follow the instructions.

### 💵 Withdraw and Deposit

To withdraw money from your in-game bank account, use this command:

```mcfunction
/trigger ec.withdraw set $amount$
```

$amount$ can be any number — the datapack will give you your money.

For example, if you type `/trigger ec.withdraw set 19302`, you’ll get 3×5000, 4×2000, 3×100, and 2×1.

You can also do the opposite and deposit your cash into your bank account. Just type:

```mcfunction
/trigger ec.deposit
```

## For Admins

If you're an admin and want to install this datapack, simply place the zip archive into your world’s datapacks folder.

You can modify player balances directly using the scoreboard:

```mcfunction
/scoreboard players set $player$ ec.money $amount$      # Sets a player's balance
/scoreboard players add @a ec.money $amount$            # Adds an amount of money to all players
/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar ec.money      # Displays balances (visible to all players)
```

If you want to uninstall the datapack, run this command:

```
/function sc_economycraft:uninstall
```

Then delete the datapack archive file.

### ⚙ Customization

The datapack is fully customizable. You can change textures for existing banknote denominations — or even add or remove denominations entirely.

#### 🏷 Changing the Currency Name

You may also want to rename your currency — and you can easily do that.

Locate the file in your resource pack:

```file
/assets/sc_economycraft/lang/en_us.json // And all languages you need
```

```json
"scec.money":"Money",
"scec.moneyformat":"%s Coins",
"item.scec.cash_1":"1 Coin",
"item.scec.cash_10":"10 Coins",
"item.scec.cash_50":"50 Coins",
"item.scec.cash_100":"100 Coins",
"item.scec.cash_200":"200 Coins",
"item.scec.cash_500":"500 Coins",
"item.scec.cash_1000":"1000 Coins",
"item.scec.cash_5000":"5000 Coins",
```


#### 🎨 Change Texture for present denominations

Simply replace the texture files in your resource pack.
They are located in:

```
/assets/sc_economycraft/textures/item/
```

#### 💵 Remove and add denominations

Removing or adding denominations requires a bit more setup.
Open the file:

```
/data/sc_economycraft/functions/settings.mcfunction
```

Find the following lines:

```mcfunction
# Default banknote denominations
# All value must be unique and in ascending order
data modify storage sc_economycraft:banknotes values set value [{v:1}, {v:10}, {v:50}, {v:100}, {v:200}, {v:500}, {v:1000}, {v:5000}]
data modify storage sc_economycraft:banknotes length_minus_one set value 7

# Default timeout duration (in ticks)
scoreboard players set timeout_duration ec.SETTINGS 600
```

To **add** or **remove** denominations:

1. Modify the list inside `values set value [...]`.
    - Each entry has the format `{v:<denomination>}`.
    - Example: to remove 5000 and add 2000, change it to
        ```mcfunction
        data modify storage sc_economycraft:banknotes values set value [{v:1}, {v:10}, {v:50}, {v:100}, {v:200}, {v:500}, {v:1000}, {v:2000}]
        ```
2. Update `length_minus_one` to match the number of denominations minus one.
    - In the example above, there are 8 denominations → set it to 7.
        ```mcfunction
        data modify storage sc_economycraft:banknotes length_minus_one set value 7
        ```

#### 💡 Tip

If you add new denominations that don’t exist in the default setup,
you’ll also need to create corresponding files in your resource pack:

- `/assets/items/cash_$your_value$.json`:
    ```json
    {
        "model": {
            "type":"minecraft:model",
            "model": "sc_economycraft:item/cash_$your_value$"
        }
    }
    ```
- `/assets/models/cash_$your_value$.json`
    ```json
    {
        "parent": "minecraft:item/generated",
        "textures": {
            "layer0": "sc_economycraft:item/cash_$your_value$"
        }
    }
    ```
- `/assets/textures/cash_$your_value$.png`
    (This is the actual texture image for your new banknote.)

And also you need to make localization for your new denominations (see [here](#-change-curency-name`))
